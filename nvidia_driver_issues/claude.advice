This seems like a common issue with NVIDIA drivers on Linux, particularly when using a minimal setup. Let's troubleshoot this systematically:

1. First, let's verify your current driver situation:
```bash
ubuntu-drivers devices
```
This will show available drivers for your system.

2. You might want to check if the NVIDIA modules are loading properly:
```bash
lsmod | grep nvidia
```

3. Since you're using a minimal setup with i3, you likely need to ensure the NVIDIA modules are properly loaded before X starts. Create or modify `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia.conf`:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia.conf
```

Add these contents:
```
Section "Device"
    Identifier     "Device0"
    Driver         "nvidia"
    VendorName     "NVIDIA Corporation"
    BoardName      "NVIDIA RTX A5000"
EndSection
```

4. You should also check if the NVIDIA modules are being loaded at boot. Create or modify `/etc/modules-load.d/nvidia.conf`:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/modules-load.d/nvidia.conf
```

Add these lines:
```
nvidia
nvidia_uvm
nvidia_drm
nvidia_modeset
```

5. Since you're using modern hardware, make sure you have these settings in your GRUB configuration (`/etc/default/grub`):
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nvidia-drm.modeset=1"
```

After modifying GRUB, update it:
```bash
sudo update-grub
```

6. You might also want to create a file to ensure the NVIDIA services start properly:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/nvidia-persistenced.service
```

Add:
```
[Unit]
Description=NVIDIA Persistence Daemon
Wants=syslog.target

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/var/run/nvidia-persistenced/nvidia-persistenced.pid
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nvidia-persistenced --verbose
ExecStopPost=/bin/rm -rf /var/run/nvidia-persistenced

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then enable it:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable nvidia-persistenced
sudo systemctl start nvidia-persistenced
```

7. Finally, regenerate your initramfs:
```bash
sudo update-initramfs -u
```

After making these changes, reboot your system. This should ensure that:
- The NVIDIA modules are loaded properly at boot
- X server has the correct configuration for your GPU
- The persistence daemon is running
- DRM modeset is enabled for better compatibility

If you still have issues after implementing these changes, we can look at your X.org logs (`/var/log/Xorg.0.log`) to see what might be going wrong. Would you like me to help analyze those logs if the problem persists?
